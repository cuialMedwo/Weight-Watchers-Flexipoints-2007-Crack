## How Does Weight Watchers Flexipoints (2007) Work?
     
The Weight Watchers Flexipoints (2007) program works by giving you a daily and weekly allowance of points that you can spend on any food or drink you want. The points are calculated using a formula that takes into account the calories, fat, and fiber of each food item. The higher the calories and fat, the more points the food has. The higher the fiber, the fewer points the food has. You can also earn extra points by doing physical activity.
     
The program also provides you with a points slider that helps you determine the points value of any food without having to look it up in a book or online. The slider has two parts: a wheel and a window. You align the wheel with the calories and fat of the food, and then read the points value in the window. The slider is designed to be portable and easy to use.
